# Full Sail University Web Design and Development
This repository is a consolidation of all my committed work at FSU, preserved for historical purposes. I graduated in 2015, so most of this code is quite old (for a fast-moving web).

## Security (Important!)
There are known vulnerabilities in some of the dependencies. If, for some strange reason, you use any of this code, please update the dependencies so that you're not baking in bad security to your next project.
