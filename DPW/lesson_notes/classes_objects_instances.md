# FSU: Classes, Objects, and Instances
* a class is a set of instructions for building an object, what traits the object has and what behaviors the object can *do*
* many **instances** can be created from a class (instantiating)
* objects have
    * attributes: the traits that describe an object
        * object.attribute = value
        * attributes are objects, too, and can have properties of their own
            * object.attribute.attribute = value
        * public attributes
            * like self.attribute
        * private attributes
            * accessible *only* when the class is defined
            * self.__attribuite (that's 2 underscores)
        * protected attributes
            * accessible by subclasses
            * self._attribute (that's 1 underscore)
    * properties
    * methods
