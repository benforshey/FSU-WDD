## Navigation
###Primary
Interact with the prototype. Ineractions should function as expected.

###Secondary
If you get stuck, just click the Logo (in the upper left) and an offscreen navigation will appear.

## Markup
Using BEM-like [Modular CSS Naming Conventions](http://thesassway.com/advanced/modular-css-naming-conventions) with a touch of SMACSS.

## Layout
Using Bourbon Neat for the grid system.

## Revision Control
Git was used directly through the command line. Yay for learning something new.
