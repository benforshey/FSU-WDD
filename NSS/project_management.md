# Notes on project management video.
# Project Management (APM)
## 1) Define the Project
Do it in writing.
PID = project initiation document
* cost
* quality
* time

Don't agree to what you can't deliver; don't say maybe (that sounds like a yes to eager ears).
What's the key driver? Which of the three branches in the PID (cost, qualtiy, time) is the most important for this project.

## 2) Planning
List the tasks via team brainstorm / write anything you can think of.
Then structure the task into a work breakdown structure (a tree diagram of tasks).
Also look at history (what happened last time we tried to do this) or ask an expert.

## 3) Estimate
Estimate the time and cost.
Don't go with the average time it might take to complete; go with halfway between average and wost case.
eg, If you think something will take 4 weeks, but it might take 6 weeks, put 5 weeks as your estimate.

## 4) Network Diagram / Criticial Path Diagram
Sticky notes work great for this step.
* Write all the tasks down on sticky notes.
* Arrange them in roughly the right order.
* Draw arrows to connect them in specificly the right order.

## 5) Crashing (speeding it up)
If you're not happy with how long the project will take, you can speed it up.
Can be done by increasing cost or decresing quality.
Perhaps overlap some the tasks to increase time efficiency.
Only crash tasks on the critical path (the long one).

## 6) Gantt Chart
Put in critical path first.
All floating paths can hang off the critical path.
A Gantt chart fosters communication, resource planning, and allows progress monitoring.
## 7) Resource Planning
Speaking of the current project, but also of the sum of all projects that you're working on (if applicable).

## 8) Risk
Particularly, look at the critical path and see what could go wrong.
It is reasonably likely and reasonably serious? What can we do to mitigate the severity or probability.

## Commit to the Project
After all the planning, you may find youself unable to commit to the project.
If so, you have excellent reasoning and documentation (Gantt chart).
Be assertive.

## 9) Monitor Progress
Combine with number 10.

## 10) Monitor Cumulative Cost
It's no good to be doing wonderfully on progress but horribly on cost. Monitor them both.

## 11) Decide to Slip or Crash (Reschedule)
Usually not a comfortable process. Leave margin in the estimation step (step 4)

## 12) Review
What was good. What was bad. What could we have done better.
