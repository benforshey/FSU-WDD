# Software Development Life Cycle

## 1) Initiate
Found a problem to solve, a need to be filled.
* value-added reasoning
* fact-finding sessions
May come away with a Project Initiation Document, or a Charter, or a Scope and Plan.

## 2) Define
Get input from SME (subject matter experts) to help define. Come away with Key 
Performance Indicators - Project Manager, Requrements - Business Analyst, Test Plan - 
Quality Assurance.

## 3) Design
Come away with functional specifications (FSPEC). QA, PM, BA will all have to update 
their plans, as the evolution of the design affects its definition.

## 4) Build
Should come away with a minimum viable product and some testing results.

## 5) Test
Designers and Developers should not be the only testers, as bias (*intentional or 
unintentional*) will cloud practical empathy.

## 6) Deployment
Yes, it does.
