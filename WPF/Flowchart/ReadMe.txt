There are two files here, one is a .jpg and one is a .pdf. Both files are copies of the same flowchart, but GitHub.com does not display .pdf natively (you have to click "View Raw"). The .pdf is of higher quality (and is the required format), but the .jpg displays in your browser window. Please choose whichever file best suits your needs.
